## Usage

1. Add the following to your Cargo.toml:
```toml
[dependencies]
pam-client = "0.4"
```

2. Read the [crate documentation](https://docs.rs/pam-client/)

## Functionality

The `pam-client` crate a safe API to the application-faced parts of PAM.
This includes in detail:

- PAM authentication, account validation and session management
- PAM password changing
- Three sample conversation handler implementations
- Custom conversation handlers via trait implementation
- On-the-fly switching of the conversation handler
- Suspendable RAII session handling
- Methods for refreshing and reinitialization of PAM credentials
- PAM environment list support with easy integration to `std::process::Command`
  and `nix::unistd::execve`
- Getters and setters for all standard and most Linux-specific PAM items.
- Raw access methods for non-standard PAM items
- Errors mostly convertible to `std::io::Error`

## Features

- `cli`: by default a conversation handler for command line applications is
  included. Disable this feature if you don't need it to remove a dependency
  on [`rpassword`].
- `serde`: enable this feature to get `serde` (de-)serialization support for
  the error, flag and token types and the default conversation handlers.
  Additionally `EnvList` becomes serializable into `[(OsStr, OsStr)]`.
 
## Supported Rust versions

The minimum supported Rust toolchain version is Rust **1.46.0**.

Currently tested up to version 1.64.0-nightly.

## Platform support

The `pam-client` crate is currently only tested on Linux, but support is
implemented for Solaris and OpenPAM-based platforms like NetBSD.

## Stability

This crate follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) with the additional
promise that below `1.0.0` backwards-incompatible changes will not be
introduced with only a patch-level version number change.

## Comparison with similar crates

This crate provides safe wrappers for the same library as [`pam`].
This crate aims to provide safe wrappers for different use cases at
the expense of a slightly more complex interface, while [`pam`] provides
an easier interface, but restricts the order of operations to the
most common use cases.
